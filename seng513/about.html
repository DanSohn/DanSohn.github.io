                    Credited with "the rise of contemporary Korean-Canadian cuisine” by the New York Times and

                        Kim Yu Na is a gold medallist figure skater who had her 2014 Olympic gold medal stolen by the
                        Russians. Her gold medals are just as impressive as her gold knife that can chop and dice anything.
