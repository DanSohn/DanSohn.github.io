Instructions:
Use this calculator like any other! Go to the url above, and it will be ready to go right away.

Some features:
If you press equal multiple times, it will keep the same value that was just computed
If you press an operator, after pressing an operator, it will replace, not just add it on and provide an error. User experience!

To reuse the previous calculation, you just have to continue with it with an operator. Using a digit, will instead restart a new calculation

BS means clear / backspace, and will backspace once
AC means all clear, and will wipe the whole user input
