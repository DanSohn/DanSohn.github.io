# My Chat App
## Utilizing HTML/CSS, JQuery, nodejs and Socket.io

I am implementing a web application for online chatting, that can handle over 10+ users. Have not tested with more devices. 
Uses cookies to store state (username, and preferred color)

To run on different devices:
on the computer you are running the server on, go to cmd and type

replace localhost:3001 with your ip address:3001, so ex. 192.1.65.123:3001
